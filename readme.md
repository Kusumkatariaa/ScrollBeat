ScrollBeat – Interactive Music Experience

- Project Overview

In this project, I created a mini interactive music web application called ScrollBeat.
The goal of this project was to strengthen my understanding of JavaScript DOM manipulation and mouse events while building a functional and visually interactive UI.
